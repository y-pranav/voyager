# AI Trip Planner Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### Backend: Hotel Search Tool
- Transformed the hotel search tool to return structured JSON data instead of formatted text
- Enhanced sample data generation to create 8-15 varied hotel options
- Added detailed hotel properties including:
  - Star ratings and user ratings
  - Room types
  - Amenities (WiFi, Pool, etc.)
  - Location details and distance to city center
  - Refund policies and breakfast information
  - Price per night and total price
- Implemented a sophisticated "best value" ranking algorithm that considers:
  - User ratings
  - Price
  - Amenities
  - Whether breakfast is included
  - Refund policy
- Ensured all numeric values are properly serialized as floats
- Added comprehensive search parameters including filters for:
  - Budget constraints
  - Star rating requirements
  - Hotel type (hotel, resort, hostel)
- Maintained compatibility with the frontend data structure

### Frontend: Hotel Display
- Added TypeScript interfaces for hotel data
- Implemented a responsive HotelDisplay component that shows:
  - Hotel name, rating, and star level
  - Price per night and total price
  - Amenities and room type
  - Location and distance from city center
  - Breakfast and cancellation policy
- Added pagination to show a limited number of hotels initially with "show more" option
- Included safety checks for missing or malformed data
- Matched the UI styling with the existing flight display for consistency

## API Structure
The hotel search tool now returns data in the following structure:
```json
{
  "formatted": "Text description for LLM consumption",
  "hotels": {
    "options": [
      {
        "id": "hotel_1",
        "name": "Hotel Name",
        "rating": 4.5,
        "star_level": 4,
        "price_per_night": 5000.0,
        "total_price": 25000.0,
        "currency": "INR",
        "amenities": ["WiFi", "Pool", "Gym"],
        "room_type": "Deluxe Room",
        "location": "Mumbai - City Center",
        "distance_to_center": 1.5,
        "breakfast_included": true,
        "refundable": true,
        "cancellation_policy": "Free cancellation",
        ...
      },
      ...
    ],
    "status": "sample_data",
    "disclaimer": "Sample hotel data for demonstration purposes"
  },
  "search_params": {
    "location": "Mumbai",
    "check_in_date": "2025-07-15",
    "check_out_date": "2025-07-20",
    "guests": 2,
    "rooms": 1,
    "nights": 5,
    ...
  },
  "price_range": {
    "min_per_night": 3000.0,
    "max_per_night": 8000.0,
    "min_total": 15000.0,
    "max_total": 40000.0
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
- Integrate the hotels data into the trip planner flow
- Add filtering options for hotels (by price, rating, amenities)
- Implement sorting options (best value, lowest price, highest rating)
- Add more detailed hotel information including images and reviews
- Connect to a real hotel API when ready (maintaining the same data structure)
